- Mobile-optimized forms and buttons

üé≠ VISUAL ELEMENTS (NO IMAGES):
- Animated background elements (CSS gradients, geometric shapes, particles)

- Smooth scroll animations
- Loading animations for form submissions using pure CSS
- Interactive waitlist counter with animated numbers
- Modern button animations and states

- SEO-optimized meta tags and structure
- Fast loading and optimized performance
- Form validation and success states

INSPIRATION: Create a page that rivals the best pre-launch pages from successful startups - think Product Hunt featured launches, YC companies, and viral pre-launch campaigns.

The page should feel premium, trustworthy, and create genuine excitement about joining the waitlist.

CRITICAL: Do NOT include any <img> tags, placeholder images, or broken image references. Use only CSS-based visual elements, gradients, shapes, icons made with CSS/Unicode, and typography for all visual appeal.

Return ONLY the raw HTML content without markdown formatting.
